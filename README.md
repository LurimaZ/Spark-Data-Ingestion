# Spark-Data-Ingestion
Lines of code for data stream ingestion using spark with Twitter API
To use this script, you need to register as Twitter Developer to get:
a) API Access Tokens  
b) API Secret Access Token
c) API Consumer Keys
d) API Consumer Secret Keys

Please do not REVEAL your tokens and keys to other as they are linked to your registered Twitter Account

In this script, I'll just run spark application using Python language. 
The data crawled will be saved in .json, .csv and .txt format. 
You can use to specify to other format that you used to but I just saved using the common one only.
Fill the required input that suited the purpose of your data ingestion.
At the end of the line you would find the "stream.filter" which you can use to specify what are the topics 
that you want to ingest from twitter.

Happy Holiday and feel free to contribute more on this repo! :) -MAF-
